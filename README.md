This is followed by an exposition of the model's empirical performance before culminating in a discussion that synthesizes the insights gleaned, outlines potential practical applications, and proposes avenues for future research.

Data Collection and Preprocessing - Technical Data
In the domain of financial analytics, the rigorous collection and processing of technical data stand as a cornerstone for developing a sound investment strategy. This study centers on the S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples Index (SPXEWCS), a market segment that intricately mirrors the dynamics of economic and sectoral shifts.

Acquisition of Price Data for Constituents and Index
The initial stage of data collection entailed procuring daily price information for the SPXEWCS and its individual constituents, spanning from January 2006 to December 2023. This extensive period was strategically chosen to encompass various market cycles, such as volatility phases, growth periods, and recessions, thereby enriching the dataset for a comprehensive analysis. Sourced from Yahoo Finance, this data benefits from the platform's reputation for accuracy and currency in financial data provision.

Data Organization and Integration
Following acquisition, the data underwent a thorough structuring process and was saved in CSV format, promoting accessibility and ease of manipulation. This phase saw the creation of two pivotal datasets: constituent_prices.csv, detailing the prices of individual stocks within the SPXEWCS, and index_prices.csv, focusing on the overall movement of the index itself.

Data Cleansing and Standardization
Given the inherent complexities of financial datasets, considerable attention was devoted to data cleansing. This process included removing superfluous columns, addressing missing values with a consistent placeholder (-1), and rectifying any inconsistencies in the data. Such meticulous cleansing was imperative to ensure the dataset's integrity and reliability, crucial for subsequent analysis.

The data was then amalgamated into a singular dataframe, final_constituent_prices, facilitating a comprehensive analysis. This consolidated dataset was scrupulously checked for inconsistencies, such as duplicate rows or inadequately populated columns, to enhance data quality and streamline future analytical procedures.

Procurement of Index Time Series Data
The study also involved acquiring time-series data for the SPXEWCS index from Yahoo Finance. This dataset is essential in offering a macroscopic view of the index's performance across the selected timeframe, providing a context within which the performances of constituent stocks can be assessed and interpreted.

The phase of technical data collection and preprocessing thus established a solid foundation for the study. It encompassed a systematic methodology for data acquisition, cleansing, and organization, ensuring that the resulting datasets were all-encompassing, precise, and primed for the next steps in analytical modeling. This stage highlights the significance of accuracy and thoroughness in managing financial datasets, often characterized by their complexity and subtlety.
